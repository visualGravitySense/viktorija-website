**Translation**: "I made a payment, but the data is incorrect and the money didn't go through, is Stripe really ready for work? Maybe I need to register a Stripe Account too?"

## ✅ Root Cause Found

The current Stripe integration has these issues:

1. **Test Mode Only**: Using test API key `pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx`
2. **Simulated Payments**: No real backend server to process actual payments
3. **No Live Stripe Account**: No real Stripe account configured for live transactions
